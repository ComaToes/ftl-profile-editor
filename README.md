ftl-profile-editor
==================

A 3rd-party tool to edit user files for [FTL](https://subsetgames.com/). It depends on resources from the game directory, but the game itself will not be modified.

With this, you can unlock any or all ships and achievements in your profile, or tweak most aspects of saved games: crew, fires, breaches, stores, etc.
