The build process for this project is automated by Maven.
  http://maven.apache.org/

  If your build environment is limited to Java 1.6,
    use Maven 3.2.5 (the last to support that compiler).
  Current Java compilers should be able to build backward-compatible jars.


To build, run "mvn clean" and "mvn package" in this folder.
